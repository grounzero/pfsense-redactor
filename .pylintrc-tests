# Configuration for test files - more relaxed than main code

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable warnings that are acceptable in test code:
disable=
    # Test-specific patterns:
    W0212,  # protected-access (testing private methods)
    W0621,  # redefined-outer-name (pytest fixtures)
    W0613,  # unused-argument (pytest fixtures)
    W0611,  # unused-import (test fixtures)
    W0612,  # unused-variable (test setup)
    W1510,  # subprocess-run-check (intentional in tests)
    
    # Import patterns:
    C0415,  # import-outside-toplevel (lazy imports for test isolation)
    C0411,  # wrong-import-order (less critical in tests)
    E0401,  # import-error (pytest not in production deps)
    
    # Design patterns acceptable in tests:
    R0801,  # duplicate-code (similar test patterns)
    R0903,  # too-few-public-methods (test classes)
    R0913,  # too-many-arguments (test fixtures)
    R0914,  # too-many-locals (test setup)
    R0915,  # too-many-statements (comprehensive tests)
    R1713,  # consider-using-join (test string building can be explicit)
    
    # Style choices in tests:
    C0103,  # invalid-name (test function names can be descriptive)
    C0301,  # line-too-long (test assertions can be descriptive)

[BASIC]
# Allow descriptive test names and common variables
good-names=i,j,k,ex,_,ip,id,f

[FORMAT]
max-line-length=120

[DESIGN]
# More relaxed limits for tests:
max-args=10
max-attributes=20
max-branches=20
max-locals=20
max-statements=100
max-returns=10
